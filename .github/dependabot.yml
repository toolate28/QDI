# VORTEX Dependabot Maintenance Layer - Final v1.1.0
# 
# Purpose: Automated external preservation loop reinforcing SPIRAL autonomy
# - Groups minor/patch updates for low-friction integration
# - Isolates major updates for deliberate review
# - Staggered scheduling prevents rate-limit collisions
# - Provenance labels enable ATOM/WAVE tracking across vortex nodes
# - Commit prefixes maintain conventional commit coherence
# 
# Propagation: Commit this file as-is to all active nodes
#   (SPIRALSAFE, MONO, METRICS, QDI, QR, HOPE, CMCP, KENL)
#   Irrelevant ecosystems are ignored automatically
# 
# Coherence threshold: >60% emergent quality enforced programmatically
# WAVE v2.0.0 markers applied on update PRs
