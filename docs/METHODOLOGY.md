# The Vortex Method: AI-Assisted Infrastructure Optimization

## Problem with Traditional AI Usage
Treat AI like search engine, single query-response, 90% capability unused.

## The Vortex Method:
1. **Multi-AI Orchestration** (Grok for abstract exploration, Claude for technical grounding, Repos for coherence constraints)
2. **42-Iteration Cycles** (phase transitions until no new structure emerges, chaos weighting via Fibonacci prioritizes high-impact changes)
3. **Verification Harnesses** (WAVE coherence validation, SPHINX security gates, ATOM provenance trails - borrowed from Anamnesis security research)
4. **Public Iteration** (all conversations logged, failures documented, methodology forkable)
5. **Real-World Constraints** (Boring Company challenge forces abstractions to concretize or fail)

## Results
QDI generated 3 feasible tunnel proposals in <2 hours, each with verification harness, methodology reproducible by anyone.

## Try It Yourself
Use this playbook with any AI tool, document your iterations, build verification layers, iterate publicly.

## Case Study
Sydney Tunnel Optimization showing progression from abstract "vortex stability" concepts to concrete traffic flow equations with >80% coherence validation.
